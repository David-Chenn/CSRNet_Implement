## Dataset
This model need the dataset ```ShanghaiTech_Crowd_Counting_Dataset``` which you can download from the link below
ShanghaiTech_Crowd_C ounting_Dataset was first introduced in ```Single-Image Crowd Counting via Multi-Column Convolutional Neural Network, 2016```, which is a new large-scale crowd counting dataset named Shanghaitech which contains 1198 annotated images, with a total of 330,165 people with centers of their heads anno-tated
